<p><em>&#8211; Award winning* SEC registered investment manager changes name to demonstrate the firm’s dedication to digital assets &#8211;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8211; Commitment to compliance and stringent risk management has served Wave Digital Assets well throughout recent volatility and uncertainty &#8211;</em></p>



<p><em>01 March, 2023, Los Angeles, US and London, UK</em> &#8211; <a href="https://wavegp.com/">Wave Digital Assets</a> (Wave), the award winning SEC registered digital asset investment management company, is pleased to announce its change of business name. Previously known as Wave Financial, the transition provides clarity as to the company’s dedication to the provision of regulated, responsible and well risk-managed digital asset investment management solutions. It also serves to delineate Wave’s provision of products and services to qualified investors including crypto-native high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporate treasuries, blockchain protocols, private banks, asset allocators and web3 corporations.</p>



<p>Since being founded in 2018 and becoming the first SEC recognized registered investment advisor exclusively for digital assets, Wave has managed approximately AUM of $1billion. Wave has established itself as a leader in the space having made strategic acquisitions in 2022 and seeking further transactions in 2023.</p>



<p>John Caldwell, Partner at Wave Digital Assets said:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Wave offers its clients the confidence of the traditional finance world, without sacrificing exposure to exciting and disruptive technologies. We focus on the intersection of blockchain, and web 3 &#8211; a rich landscape of interoperable digital assets.”</em></p>



<p>Wave is one of the few digital asset companies that has expanded recently, with headcount increasing over 50% over the past six months, during a period when many other firms have had to retrench.</p>



<p>David Siemer, Co-Founder and CEO at Wave Digital Assets said:</p>



<p><em>“Wave is successfully navigating the current ‘Crypto Winter’ and has been a beneficiary of recent market conditions, following a volatile 2022 in the digital asset space, avoiding involvement in the major industry crises like Terra Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Celcius and FTX. Having made our first acquisition in Europe recently, we are in advanced talks for further M &amp; A activity both in the US and Asia. As the business has established itself, now is the perfect time to provide clarity and conviction by changing our name to Wave Digital Assets.”</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p><strong>Why is Wave changing our name?</strong></p>



<p>The transition from Wave Financial to Wave Digital Assets comes at a time of growth for us. Wave was founded on digital asset investing, and is one of the first investment managers registered with the SEC solely managing digital assets.</p>



<p>We strive to deliver smart capital strategies, deep institutional expertise, and dynamic, cutting-edge ideas seeking to maximize the value of the digital assets we manage, in the best interests of our investors. Our new name – Wave Digital Assets – represents our relentless commitment to advancing the sophistication of risk-managed digital asset investment strategies for our clients while promoting global adoption of disruptive emerging technologies.</p>



<p><strong>What is the significance of our rebrand?</strong></p>



<p>Wave is navigating the current “Crypto Winter” successfully to date. We have managed to avoid not one, but two of the largest “black swan events” in our industry&#8217;s short history, all while investing in new businesses, scaling our team, and expanding our international footprint. We recognize that market downturns are often the price of innovation, and what it takes for new markets to emerge in an unfamiliar industry. After all, Wave was born in a bear market.</p>



<p>The crypto industry is currently at an inflection point as we navigate to identify the hallmark institutions that we believe will have a lasting impact on finance and technology as a whole. Perceptions are changing, and the process of crypto acceptance, integration and adoption has accelerated since the pandemic. This is an exciting milestone that comes at a critical time in the marketplace.</p>



<p>We recognized this opportunity early on, and with this movement comes Wave’s inspiration for rebranding. This rebrand symbolizes the strides we have made as an organization &#8211; a leader in the industry &#8211; at the forefront of innovation and modernization. There is more to come &#8211; and while our new company name and brand helps to embody our growth, it also allows us to strategically position ourselves for years to come.</p>



<p><strong>What does this rebrand mean for our partners and customers?</strong></p>



<p>Although this may seem like a big change, rest assured, our unwavering commitment to our values, our investors, and our core philosophy remains the same. Wave will continue to expand on new and innovative products and services to serve our clients’ current and evolving needs, just with a new and improved look.</p>



<p>The time has come for Wave to differentiate ourselves from the competition and ensure we continue to exceed our clients&#8217; expectations. Wave is here to help investors unlock the door to regulated financial freedom with Smart Crypto Investing. Welcome to the new Wave Digital Assets.</p>

<p><em>The Wave Stable Asset Yield Fund is designed to capture attractive yields with minimal volatility and low beta to cryptocurrency price movements.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>10 May, 2022, Los Angeles, US</em> &#8211; <a href="https://wavegp.com/">Wave Financial LLC</a>&nbsp;(Wave), the SEC regulated digital asset investment management company, is pleased to announce that following increased investor demand, it is launching its 8th digital asset fund with over $60m in committed seed capital, which will complement its existing offerings that include an index, real asset, income, VC and NFT funds. The Wave Stable Asset Yield Fund (SAYF) is designed to deploy capital via stablecoins into decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to generate a target yield of 8-12% per annum and will have an emphasis on low volatility as historically exhibited by stablecoins. The fund will also offer monthly dividend and liquidity for maximum flexibility for the investors.</p>



<p>“In keeping with Wave’s objective to unlock the potential of digital assets, we created an instrument which allows high net worth and institutional investors to more easily take advantage of the yields available in the DeFi market,” says Benjamin Tsai, Co-Founder and President of Wave Financial.&nbsp; “The low volatility (historically less than 1% pa) exhibited by stablecoins and the monthly redemption feature makes this instrument ideally suitable for cash management and alternative yield.”</p>



<p>“Digital asset capital markets are characterized by rapid innovation, generating attractive yields and high volatility. Stablecoins are an innovative tool for investors to capture those yields while limiting their exposure to the volatility,” added Henry Elder, Head of Decentralized Finance at Wave Financial and Portfolio Manager for the Wave Stable Asset Yield Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wave Financial is one of the few digital asset managers to be regulated in the US by the SEC, which demonstrates their commitment to the highest standards of investment management. The popularity of their fund and wealth management products has resulted in AUM growth from under $100 million in 2020 to over $1 billion in 2022.</p>

<p><em>The ADA Yield Fund aims to provide liquidity and other resources to Cardano’s rapidly expanding DeFi platform startups&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>30 March, 2022, Los Angeles, US / Singapore</em> &#8211; <a href="https://wavegp.com/">Wave Financial LLC</a>&nbsp;(Wave), a SEC regulated digital asset investment management company, is pleased to announce the launch of the Wave ADA Yield Fund.&nbsp; The fund is designed to provide liquidity with millions in line to support new decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms launched in the Cardano ecosystem starting with an initial $100M.</p>



<p>“We’re thrilled to continue breaking ground in the field of cryptocurrency through the creation of innovative new funds, and today we are launching what we believe is the first pure liquidity provisioning fund in crypto,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Financial. “Our new fund will support the new decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and stablecoin issuers building on Cardano. Each of these decentralized applications adds to the strong foundation of the Cardano blockchain as it realizes a fully functional and diverse ecosystem.”</p>



<p>The new ADA Yield Fund represents the continuation of Wave’s mission to support promising entrepreneurs within the crypto space beyond the early stage and foster greater innovation in the overall crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Since the formal launch of smart contracts in 2021, the Cardano community has launched and funded hundreds of companies building on the Cardano blockchain,” said Charles Hoskinson, founder of Input Output, the software technology company that has been an early supporter of Cardano. “Cardano’s growing ecosystem is hosting an ever expanding universe of applications supporting significant numbers of active users – it’s critical for the success of the ecosystem that Cardano-based projects thrive, and so we are pleased that the ADA Yield Fund is committing substantial financial resources to facilitate continued growth and market acceptance.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Historically, DeFi dApps are among the most popular in crypto in terms of bringing more users and applications&nbsp; on-chain. Specifically, decentralized exchanges (DEX) and defi lenders have gained the fastest popularity in terms of attracting users and capital. DEX typically are set up without market makers, but with two pools of assets that represent each side of a trading pair that serve as a source for DEX counterparties to trade against when they want to transact on either side of the pair. Wave will be using the ADA Yield Fund to provide liquidity to these pairs of pools to support Cardano DEXes. For DeFi lenders, there will also be a similar form of support to augment liquidity to facilitate lending. Also, Wave will continue to support and expand stake pools to strengthen the Cardano network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;EMURGO is excited to support the creation of this valuable ADA Yield Fund to further drive expansion and adoption of Cardano&#8217;s quickly developing DeFi ecosystem,&#8221; said Ken Kodama, founder &amp; CEO of EMURGO, a global blockchain solutions company and venture capital fund that has also been an early supporter of Cardano. &#8220;Providing strategic capital resources through the fund will help talented entrepreneurs and projects to build essential DeFi services on Cardano, ultimately delivering impactful solutions and onboarding more users to the global Cardano community.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wave is registered with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission as an investment adviser. To learn more about Wave Financial, please visit <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3289020-1&amp;h=3780648448&amp;u=https://wavegp.com/&amp;a=wavegp.com">wavegp.com</a>.

<p></p>



<p><em>Wave has many relationships with and around the Cardano network, including because it manages funds/accounts focused on supporting the growth of the Cardano network. In particular, both Input Output (IOG) and EMURGO were investors in the ADA Yield Fund at the time of this press release&#8217;s publication, and are also clients of Wave, and IOG is an investor in Wave&#8217;s parent company. Neither IOG nor EMURGO were compensated for their statements in this press release; however, each had financial incentives to make such statements promoting the ADA Yield Fund due to their own investments in the ADA Yield Fund, their holdings of Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, and relationships with Cardano, and IOG&#8217;s investment in Wave.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>– Managed by SEC regulated digital asset investment manager Wave Financial and distributed by Swiss asset manager Criptonite Asset Management SA –</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>– The “Wave Non Fungible Fund” is the first NFT focused digital asset investment product distributed in Switzerland –</em></strong></p>



<p><em>28, March, 2022 – Geneva, Switzerland / Los Angeles, US</em> – <a href="https://www.criptoniteam.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Criptonite Asset Management</a> SA is pleased to announce that it will distribute the <a href="https://wavegp.com"><strong>Wave Financial</strong></a><strong> Non Fungible Fund (NFF)</strong>. Wave is an SEC regulated digital asset investment fund manager based in Los Angeles. Following the launch of the NFT fund in December 2021, Wave Financial, which manages over $1 billion across its digital asset fund, institutional and wealth management products, has seen unprecedented demand globally attracting investment over $20 million from qualified investors already. Criptonite Asset Management SA will offer the NFT fund to qualified investors in Switzerland.</p>



<p>Florian Rais &#8211; CEO and Founder of Criptonite Asset Management SA, said:</p>



<p><em>“Following on from the Wave Bitcoin Income &amp; Growth AMC launch early this year, I am delighted that we are able to deepen our partnership bringing this unique high quality NFT fund product to qualified investors in Switzerland. NFTs are uniquely innovative, important digital assets and the investment landscape is still at a stage of rapid evolution. It is incredibly important that accredited investors have access to experienced professionally managed fund products and Wave Financial is a leader in providing choice to those that want it.”</em></p>



<p>Matteo Dante Perruccio, President International at Wave Financial, said:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“NFTs are rapidly becoming a highly sought-after asset class among professional investors but they are also a complex asset, with a strong community aspect that requires deep experience and knowledge to navigate. Given the shortage of well-managed products, Wave Financial brings the rigours of traditional investing and sound risk management to the digital assets space. We want to provide investors looking for exposure to NFTs and the metaverse, the means to diversify their portfolios in this way, but through a fund responsibly managed by a regulated entity.”</em></p>



<p>Wave Financial’s NFT fund has a unique open-ended structure. Through actively participating in the NFT community and multi-platform social media engagement, the fund managers strive to gain exclusive access to multiple NFT drops. The fund, registered with the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, invests in NFT collectibles, platforms, and protocols, with a view to the future of the sub-asset class and the integration of NFT technology in areas such as the metaverse and decentralised finance. Currently, around 70% of allocations are to the thriving digital art and collectibles space, where an analytical approach includes analysis based on the rarity of traits, with a focus on value drivers such as unique content and scarcity in properties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appointing a Swiss representative of the NFT fund “NFF” in Switzerland comes as Wave Financial continues to expand its presence and product offering internationally, having already partnered with Criptonite Asset Management to offer Wave’s flagship BTC Income &amp; Growth strategy through an AMC tracker.</p>



<p>The NFT fund is available to qualified investors only. Potential investors are checked for suitability to ensure that the NFT fund meets their investment objectives, in accordance with relevant local rules and regulations.</p>
