Excess premium above the target yield, minus a performance fee, would be credited back to the Fund to purchase more BTC, contributing to the&nbsp;<strong>growth<\/strong>&nbsp;of NAV. The Fund would generate this premium by selling call options with strikes higher than the current price, which also leaves room for investors to capture potential BTC upside. Fidelity Digital Assets will provide custody for the Fund&#8217;s BTC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For high net worth investors, appetite for innovative yield product with upside potential is strong. &nbsp;This product monetizes higher volatility of BTC to deliver yield, independent of the interest rate environment, while keeping some upside exposure,&#8221; said Benjamin Tsai, President of Wave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For investors that are interested,&nbsp;<strong>Wave BTC Income &amp; Growth Digital Fund<\/strong>&nbsp;will issue Fund Tokens based on cryptographic technologies similar to those used for creation and transfer of select virtual currencies. Wave anticipates that Tokens will be able to be traded on alternative trading systems at a later date.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The mission of Wave is to provide investors with diversified exposure to crypto assets,&#8221; said David Siemer, CEO of Wave. &#8220;This is an alternative way to hold BTC exposure.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potential investors should be aware that an investment in Fund\/Tokens involves a high degree of risk. Please read the private placement memorandum carefully for a discussion of the most significant risks to such an investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An investment in Fund\/Tokens is suitable only for sophisticated investors who have experience investing in private funds employing the Fund&#8217;s strategies, are familiar with investing in and trading Crypto Assets and can afford the loss of their entire investment in Fund\/Tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fund will sell Fund\/Tokens only outside the United States to non-US persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 or, within the United States, only to &#8220;accredited investors&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Rule 506(c) of Regulation D. The Fund\/Tokens are only available for purchase through the Fund or broker\/dealers engaged by Wave on behalf of the Fund. For additional information, please contact&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:operations@wavegp.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">operations@wavegp.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offer and sale of the Fund Tokens, the Fund, and its managers are not and will not be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are not subject to disclosure and certain other requirements mandated by U.S. federal securities laws, and investors therefore will not benefit from the protection of such laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities in the United States or in any other jurisdictions. Offers to sell the Fund Tokens are made solely pursuant to the Fund&#8217;s private placement memorandum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forward-Looking Statements<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This press release contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221;. &nbsp;Forward-looking statements can be identified by words like, &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; and similar expressions. &nbsp;Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance.
