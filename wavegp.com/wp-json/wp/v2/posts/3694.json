The index currently captures over 93% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, and aims to provide superior pure beta (market) exposure. The index\u2019s largest components include current market leaders, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP). Its smallest holdings include a number of fringe currencies, such as Basic Attention Token (BAT) and NEM (XEM). The index is constructed to be tradable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEven as sophisticated and institutional investors increasingly diversify their holdings to include digital assets, there are few complete ways to effectively track the cryptocurrency market,\u201d said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Financial. \u201cWe designed the index to reflect not only the performance of leaders such as Bitcoin, but also emerging assets which offer positive upside as their adoption increases. Through monthly rebalancing, the index simplifies tracking the health of the cryptocurrency asset class and can adapt to rapid shifts in the marketplace.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The index was designed using a rigorous framework to reduce turnover and risk, and Wave monitors the index holdings monthly to ensure that it includes the largest crypto assets by market capitalization. Select 20 excludes stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, as they do not move with the market. The index also excludes privacy coins to avoid exposure to regulatory issues in certain countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the evolving nature of digital assets and decisions made by blockchain project leaders, Select 20 also accounts for the future possibility of forking and airdrops of index components. In the event that a fork occurs to a cryptocurrency, the value of the fork will be included in the index as an additional token until the next rebalancing date, when it can be rebalanced out of the index. If the value of the token is less than 15% of the value of the main chain, uncertain or cannot be determined, it will be calculated at zero value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that an airdrop occurs, the newly airdropped tokens will generally not be included in the index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are committed to bridging traditional asset management to what we view as the future of finance. In developing the Wave Select 20 Index, we are excited to have created a usable market benchmark to address that unique investing need,\u201d added Benjamin Tsai, President of Wave Financial. \u201cOur team of experts carefully considered what would best meet the investment demands of sophisticated investors, while also staying up-to-date with the rapid technical, regulatory and strategic factors shaping the cryptocurrency marketplace.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using an inception date of February 1, 2019, and a base value of $100, the index has risen 48.17% as of May 1, 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Risk Disclosure<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Index Related Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment. The Wave Select 20 Index represents a hypothetical, back-tested, and unaudited return-stream that does not represent the returns of an actual account. Actual returns may differ materially from hypothetical, backtested returns. Back-testing is calculated by retroactively applying an Index-weighting methodology to the historical data. Digital asset selection for index fund will be based on reasonably available data and is also subject to necessary judgement calls by management given data supply problems that currently exist in the crypto currency sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About Wave<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=iZzZ1oxBrKq94JL4giVEWwt9Pn6xARNVL2Nfd3Ukh9YY6iNjafijhyqAvvK7Dys2AGyVOoF5XKmLkxnEmH41qA==\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wave Financial<\/a>&nbsp;Group is a holding company providing investment and asset management focused on the rapidly growing digital asset and blockchain ecosystem.
