The Wave Kentucky Whiskey 2020 Digital Fund closed in December 2020 with over 2700 barrels included in the portfolio, which its projections suggest may increase in value by three to five times over five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to introduce a second fund of this nature and offer investors another path to access an otherwise hard-to-reach asset class,\u201d said Benjamin Tsai, President and Managing Partner of Wave Financial Group. \u201cBy leveraging digital tokens that represent shares in the fund, investors will be able to trade on a regulated crypto exchange as the barrels appreciate in value over time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the first iteration of the fund, the 2021 iteration will include Kentucky bourbon and rye whiskey from Wilderness Trail Distillery, a heritage member of the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association and member of the world-famous Kentucky Bourbon Trail.&nbsp; Depending on demand, additional distilleries may be added to diversify the exposure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By investing in the fund, investors will be able to capitalize on the Kentucky whiskey market in an asset class that has potential to appreciate significantly during the spirits\u2019 aging process. The anticipated alpha generation potential of the fund is designed to replicate its 2020 predecessor, which has a net asset value of +9.2% as of Q1 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe continue to produce innovative approaches to modern investing by assigning fractional ownership of tangible assets via tokenization,\u201d said Tsai. \u201cFollowing the success of the initial Whiskey Fund in 2020, this new offering further validates our investment model.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the Wave Kentucky Whiskey Digital Fund, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\">wavegp.com<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About Wave Financial<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wave Financial LLC (Wave) is a Los Angeles and London based investment management company that provides institutional and private wealth digital asset solutions.
