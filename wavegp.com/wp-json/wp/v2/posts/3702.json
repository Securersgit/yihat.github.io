Brokerage margin lending is the closest real-world comparison, justifying current crypto rates of 8\u201310%. As more potential lenders get comfortable with the technical risks, the supply of lenders will start to outweigh the demand of borrowers and margins will eventually compress. While speculation is the primary use case for crypto lending, I am optimistic there will be additional use cases for crypto lending as the technology and ecosystem matures (credit scoring, insurance, etc.)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto lending has grown significantly over the past 18 months and has gained even more attention as of late given attractive interest rates relative to typical savings accounts that earn roughly&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/banking\/savings\/rates\/?pid=&amp;sortprods=&amp;prods=&amp;ttcid=%7Cc%7Caud-301482762929:dsa-431101654769%7Cg%7C9004372&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_cmpid=1676642297&amp;utm_adgid=63552795565&amp;utm_tgtid=aud-301482762929:dsa-431101654769&amp;utm_mt=b&amp;utm_adid=325166972845&amp;utm_dvc=c&amp;utm_ntwk=g&amp;utm_adpos=1t1&amp;utm_plcmnt=&amp;utm_locphysid=9004372&amp;utm_locintid=&amp;utm_feeditemid=&amp;utm_devicemdl=&amp;utm_plcmnttgt=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_P3jBRAqEiwAZyWWaBZD5lK4OL-FRGLwvmXzN7HdiuSMFHncMF5PP8syKMSWqUQ1rb6x1RoCqEAQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">2%<\/a>&nbsp;APR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at a P2P crypto lending platform like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dharma.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dharma<\/a>, lenders can currently earn&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/05\/22\/dharma-now-supports-peer-to-peer-lending-in-usdc-to-attract-mainstream-investors-to-defi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">8% by lending their USDC<\/a>, a USD stablecoin formed as a partnership between Circle and Coinbase and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/loanscan.io\/interest-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">11% for Dai<\/a>, MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin that is also designed to be pegged to $1 USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, these rates may sound too good to be true. But, for every lender, there must be a borrower. So who is borrowing at double digit rates?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crypto Lenders<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because cryptocurrencies are so volatile, almost all crypto loans are over-collateralized. In general, they require collateral ratios of 150%+ to secure a loan, which provides some safe guards for lenders to manage counterparty risk. So a potential borrower would need to put up at least $15,000 worth of crypto (BTC, ETH, etc) as collateral to get a $10,000 loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two major types of players in the crypto lending market, Custodial and Non-Custodial lenders. The main trade-off between custodial and non-custodial lenders is around&nbsp;<strong>Counterparty Risk<\/strong>&nbsp;<em>(trusting a company)<\/em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<strong>Technical Risk<\/strong><em>&nbsp;(trusting code)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With custodial lending, I am trusting that the entity will safely custody my crypto assets and limit counterparty risk from potential borrowers, ensuring my loan gets paid back in full and on time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With non-custodial lending, I trust that the smart contract code will run as designed and does not have any bugs that will result in lost funds \/ hacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"259\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b42c77d74901962337_1lRre3Q2Hpik09Wdtw1SgPQ.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b42c77d74901962337_1lRre3Q2Hpik09Wdtw1SgPQ.png 800w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b42c77d74901962337_1lRre3Q2Hpik09Wdtw1SgPQ-768x249.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Centralized, custodial lenders include companies like&nbsp;<strong>Genesis Capital<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>BlockFi, Nexo&nbsp;<\/strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Celsius&nbsp;<\/strong>as well as centralized exchanges like&nbsp;<strong>Bitfinex, Liquid&nbsp;<\/strong>and<strong>&nbsp;BitMEX&nbsp;<\/strong>and centralized OTC desks like&nbsp;<strong>Galaxy, OSL<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Cumberland<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized, non-custodial credit protocols include&nbsp;<strong>Compound<\/strong>(decentralized money market protocol),&nbsp;<strong>Dharma<\/strong>&nbsp;(P2P lending protocol),&nbsp;<strong>MakerDAO<\/strong>&nbsp;(decentralized credit facility) and&nbsp;<strong>Uniswap&nbsp;<\/strong>(decentralized exchange that enables lenders to provide liquidity).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is certainly nuance between all of the above examples, these decentralized protocols are slowly emerging as competitors to centralized, custodial credit providers and differ mainly on lending rates &amp; custody management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, centralized providers are still the largest crypto lenders today, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/genesiscap.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Genesis Capital<\/a>, originating over $1.5B in annualized volume alone:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"231\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b32c77d7f635962336_0FDDNCE3ErEOEfiap.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3705\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b32c77d7f635962336_0FDDNCE3ErEOEfiap.jpg 800w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b32c77d7f635962336_0FDDNCE3ErEOEfiap-768x222.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/genesiscap.co\/insights\/2019-q1-insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Genesis Capital Q1 2019 Insights Report<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crypto Borrowers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Genesis Capital outlines 3 main use cases for borrowing cryptocurrencies from their clientele:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>1.

Under that lens, crypto rates start to make a little more sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokerage margin lending is profitable and relatively low risk given the collateral requirements. However, there is currently no way for the average user to supply capital and earn a profit&nbsp;<em>(unless you are the broker)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"620\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b32d98c4f9815ad1e0_1Rwy86Y-mEveUJrwUVJ6lrQ.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3712\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b32d98c4f9815ad1e0_1Rwy86Y-mEveUJrwUVJ6lrQ.png 800w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5cf180b32d98c4f9815ad1e0_1Rwy86Y-mEveUJrwUVJ6lrQ-768x595.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption>I promise this is not an ad for Interactive Brokers. But here\u2019s my reflink for 1 month of free trading: \u2026<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The unique innovation in crypto lending is that for the first time, lending platforms are able to open up the supply side via smart contracts. While some custodial lenders like Genesis and BlockFi supply capital and capture the lending margin themselves, other custodial providers like Celsius and Nexo, in addition to non-custodial lenders like dYdX, Dharma and Compound have opted to democratize the supply side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big implication being that, for the first time, any one in the world can now supply liquidity to potential borrowers and earn 8\u201310%+ APR, in a completely permissionless manner. Pretty powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that Ethereum smart contracts are still nascent, and therefore hold a high degree of technical risk&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/new-alchemy\/a-short-history-of-smart-contract-hacks-on-ethereum-1a30020b5fd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">(see: Parity multi-sig hack, DAO, etc)<\/a>. While there is currently over&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$500M+ of ETH locked up in smart contracts<\/a>&nbsp;across non-custodial lending platforms (a pretty big bug bounty), formal verification tools and the emergence of insurance solutions will slowly lower technical risks, in addition to time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few interesting examples of crypto native smart contract insurance providers are d<a href=\"https:\/\/www.defisurance.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">efisurance<\/a>, which leverages Augur prediction markets to insure deposits and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nexusmutual.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nexus Mutual,<\/a>&nbsp;a digital cooperative\/mutual that covers members against smart contract failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we are still far away from traditional insurance providers securing smart contracts as they have just starting to explore insuring custodians, any centralized \/ decentralized insurance solution will significantly drive adoption and start to level the playing field vs. centralized lending providers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After taking into account the technical risks associated with crypto lending, higher APR\u2019s for stablecoins relative to brokerage margin rates start to make sense and are still relatively underpriced given the current state of smart contracts and lack of insurance. Most recently, Zeppelin identified a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.zeppelin.solutions\/technical-description-of-makerdao-governance-critical-vulnerability-facce6bf5d5e?gi=1b3a3bc3f18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">minor bug in MakerDAO\u2019s governance contract<\/a>during Coinbase Custody\u2019s audit process. While this bug had minimal impact and wasn\u2019t related to the main set of lending smart contracts, it\u2019s important to be realistic about how nascent this technology is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Future of Crypto Lending<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer the question of how sustainable the current crypto lending markets are, it helps to take a step back and look at the aggregate supply and demand. If we indeed assume that the majority of crypto lending borrowers today are speculators, I imagine the \u201cdemand side\u201d will continue to grow as crypto continues gaining adoption and remains a volatile asset class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it\u2019s far more likely that as potential lenders eventually get comfortable with the risk\/reward trade-off and realize they too can earn 8%+, the supply side will eventually outpace the current demand from speculators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most likely scenario is that crypto lending rates will continue to increase in periods of significant volatility, but decrease on the aggregate as more individuals\/entities begin to supply liquidity and enter the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What remains to be seen is if crypto lending can start to address new use cases beyond speculation and further grow the demand side. I\u2019m particularly excited to see the emergence of decentralized credit scoring solutions enter the crypto lending space, as they will lower the restrictive 150%+ collateral requirements and open up the supply of potential borrowers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining the powerful innovation of opening up the lending supply side, introducing decentralized credit &amp; insurance solutions, and lowering the cost to serve via smart contracts, I\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll start to see crypto lending solutions address emerging markets that traditional financial institutions have historically ignored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please reach out if you are working on any part of the decentralized lending stack: roy@wavegp.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER:<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>This informational piece is intended to inform Wave Financial\u2019s audience of the current status of the crypto industry.
