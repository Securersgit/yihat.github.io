Wave has also experienced rapid growth within its suite of funds in new investments, which includes a 2020 TADS award-winning fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWave is attracting investors from around the globe looking for crypto asset exposure,\u201d continued Borsai. \u201cOur ability to provide \u2018white-glove\u2019 service, secure custody, and timely reporting to our clients is a primary growth driver in this space.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond its fund product offerings, Wave manages the fiat currency and native token treasuries of large protocols and crypto companies by providing leading edge staking, lending, and derivative yield strategies, and liquidity services. This reflects the growing demand from not only cryptocurrency firms and foundations, but also traditional financial services firms, to have their treasuries managed by highly experienced teams of investment managers and federally regulated fiduciaries. Wave is federally regulated by the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission as a registered investment adviser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur focus on institutional quality investment management, along our highly experienced team which hails from some of the most respected traditional firms, gives our clients confidence that even though we operate in a new and volatile sector, their assets are in skilled hands,\u201d said David Siemer, CEO and Co-Founder of Wave. \u201cAs the digital asset space continues to grow, traditional financial services firms and HNWIs are looking for firms that are regulated and have reputable track records such as Wave to manage their assets in both fund and bespoke solutions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wave also works with institutional custodians and offers sophisticated yield and alpha strategies for investors who want to put crypto assets to work. Digital assets entrusted to Wave typically reside with world-class qualified custodians like Fidelity Digital Assets, Coinbase Custody, and Copper Technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By applying traditional investment techniques to digital assets via its three product divisions of investment funds, wealth management, and venture capital, the Wave family of companies is increasing its AUM rapidly due to growing interest from investors who demand regulated, sophisticated and bespoke portfolio management solutions for digital assets. \u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8211; Regulated digital asset manager experiences rapid growth of AUM in its wealth &amp; treasury management and funds divisions&nbsp; &#8211; Income and capital growth strategies attract assets from HNWIs, family&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":6477,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8],"tags":[],"fund-category":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6492"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6492"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6492\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6477"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6492"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6492"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6492"},{"taxonomy":"fund-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/fund-category?post=6492"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
