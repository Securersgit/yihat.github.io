There are typically two layers of governance: off-chain and on-chain. Much has already been written on the trade-offs between on-chain and off-chain governance. This post will not explore the merits of either position, but rather the barriers and potential solutions to increased voter participation generally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchains require some form of governance to help the community make adjustments or improvements to the network, like changing certain core parameters like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Block_size_limit_controversy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Block Size<\/a>&nbsp;or adding new capabilities like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SegWit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SegWit<\/a>&nbsp;which enable scalability improvements like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lightning_Network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lightning Network<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"268\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f9cd88c7b919_1dfkeQeAuvTUvdv1TUet9cw.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3672\"\/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Melt_Dem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">h\/t to Meltem Demirors<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notable examples of off-chain governance include Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP), which are designed to introduce new features to Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical cadence of off-chain governance is as follows. First, a stakeholder&nbsp;<em>(developer, economic actor, etc.)<\/em>&nbsp;conducts research and develops a formal proposal. Proposal discussion then occurs across social mediums like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/evan_van_ness\/status\/1109136866685739008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">#CryptoTwitter<\/a>, online forums&nbsp;<em>(<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>ETHResear.ch<\/em><\/a><em>, Reddit)<\/em>, Core Developer meetings, and\/or mailing lists. The community, including Core Developers, will review the proposals, provide feedback and decide whether to accept the proposal off-chain. Generally, a significant majority is required to adopt a proposal. Once a proposal is pushed through and widely communicated, node operators will then need to upgrade their software. Proposals are typically batched together for release in a future fork<em>&nbsp;(i.e the&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/media.consensys.net\/the-constantinople-hard-fork-what-you-need-to-know-d438a91dec3f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Constantinople hard fork&nbsp;<\/em><\/a><em>included 5 EIPs).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, on-chain governance activity occurs \u201con the blockchain\u201d. The major implementations of on-chain governance today feature on-chain voting like Decred\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/proposals.decred.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Politeia<\/a>, which allows stakeholders to vote on funding for Decred\u2019s treasury, or Tezos\u2019 multi-step amendment process, in which Tezos token holders can vote on protocol-level changes, such as increasing gas limits as proposed in the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/welcome-to-athens-tezos-completes-historic-first-blockchain-vote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Athens<\/a>&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;<em>(more on that later<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While unproven, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@Vlad_Zamfir\/against-on-chain-governance-a4ceacd040ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many<\/a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2018\/03\/28\/plutocracy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">prominent<\/a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/soon-chain-governance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">critics<\/a>&nbsp;noting that on-chain voting can lead to plutocracies and oligopolies, the broader trend of on-chain governance is an important narrative to watch as blockchains continue to evolve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those interested in reading more about governance, I highly recommend Fred Ehrsam\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@FEhrsam\/blockchain-governance-programming-our-future-c3bfe30f2d74\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blockchain Governance: Programming our Future<\/a>\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Decentralized Voter Turnout<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As on-chain governance continues to evolve, there has been momentum with several on-chain votes recently taking place.

In addition, all 3 protocols provide voters with a direct incentive to participate via Proof of Stake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decred\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.decred.org\/faq\/proof-of-stake\/buying-tickets-and-fees\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ticket system<\/a>&nbsp;allows voters to earn rewards and secure the network by locking up Decred\u2019s native token, DCR, while coupling the ticket with on-chain voting. With over 45% of the total available supply of DCR participating in Proof of Stake mining, DCR stakeholders can earn roughly 12.5% annually by staking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Cosmos yields are hovering around 11% with a solid participation rate at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/staked_us\/status\/1111707940266934272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">46.5%<\/a>, which is notable given that&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/coinmonks\/cosmos-atom-staking-guide-4a4e703c998a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">20% of the Genesis Supply<\/a>&nbsp;is currently locked up&nbsp;<em>(Interchain Foundation\u2019s 10% is vesting for 6\u201312 months, ALL IN BITS\u2019 10% is subject to a 2 year vesting period)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos\u2019 similarly has a high proportion of total available supply mining via Proof of Stake at 81%, although their staking yield is slightly lower at ~7.4% annually. However, simply looking only at staking yield is only half the picture without taking into account annual inflation rates&nbsp;<em>(potentially a future post)<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this added financial incentive via Proof of Staking mining rewards likely contributes to Tezos\u2019, Cosmos\u2019 and Decred\u2019s higher voter turnout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stepping back, the question naturally arises: why is there such a large delta within on-chain voting?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, not all proposals are created equal: without picking on 0x,<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.0xproject.com\/zeip-23-vote-post-mortem-311c9323e228\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">&nbsp;ZEIP-23&nbsp;<\/a>may not be as important to 0x as the stability fee is for Maker to support Dai\u2019s peg at $1). Below are general thoughts on a few high level barriers to voter participation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Incentives<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cShow me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2014 Charlie Munger<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On-chain governance\u2019s underlying assumption is that because token holders and \u201cowners\u201d of a protocol are one and the same, they are economically incentivized to vote in the protocol\u2019s best interest. If tokenholders vote for a proposal that has a negative effect on the protocol, the token\u2019s price will reflect that decision and they will lose money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While voters are theoretically incentivized to govern given their passive ownership in the underlying network, they may need more \u201cskin in the game\u201d to actively participate. Otherwise voters will remain apathetic if the issue at hand is of a low degree of importance, as shown in practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe we\u2019ll continue to see future on-chain voting implementations be strongly coupled with direct financial incentives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subject Matter Expertise<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tokenholders are not always subject matter experts. For example, a casual holder of MKR may not have the economics background required to vote on the implications of an increase or decrease in Maker\u2019s stability fee. Likewise, a retail<em>&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/h\/hodl.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>hodler<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;likely does not have the technical expertise required to evaluate the merits of implementing&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/as-progpow-aimed-at-stopping-asic-mining-gets-supporting-votes-new-conspiracies-and-debates-appear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ProgPOW<\/a>&nbsp;on Ethereum. Given the time required to truly understand the ramifications of a proposal vote, voter apathy may be higher for more complex proposals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community leaders can help address this with market education (i.e. Jacob Arluck\u2019s piece outlining&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tezos\/tezos-athens-379f6a0d5332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Tezos Athens<\/a>) but the average hodler just may not be willing to devote significant time researching the nuances and implications of a specific proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Voting Infrastructure<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While there have been significant strides to improve voting infrastructure, a lack of sophisticated voting tools leads to friction when attempting to vote. Maker actually has one of the better voting user experiences, but the below snapshot showcases the reality of all voting infrastructure today and outlines the various steps required to vote on the most recent stability fee hike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"590\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f9b143c7b91b_0apLCuDmf27Lw2tIg.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3675\"\/><figcaption>Governance Voting Dashboard via vote.makerdao.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, voters are required to have ETH in their wallets AND need to pay gas so they can connect to Maker\u2019s voting portal, which requires 4 transactions at roughly $1. In addition, linking cold and hot wallets is a requirement\u200a\u2014\u200abut what if smaller voters don\u2019t have MKR on a cold wallet? Voters may get stuck and give up, as I did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To play devil\u2019s advocate, Maker may only want more sophisticated investors to participate and requiring a cold wallet may be a natural filter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the broader point still stands that meaningful improvements are needed to reduce voter friction in order for crypto to go mainstream. This rings true not just for voting, but for decentralized applications in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"426\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f9a322c7b91d_1pzxYlYQ9xgc5_oQZML_MuQ.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3676\"\/><figcaption>Snapshot of Coinbase Custody\u2019s Maker Governance interface<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voting infrastructure will inevitably mature, with Coinbase Custody recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-custody-launches-staking-support-for-tezos-makerdao-governance-to-follow-68f7bc51bc53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcing their addition of governance support for Maker<\/a>&nbsp;as well as intention to add Tezos voting in Q2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I expect other custodians will follow in Coinbase\u2019s foot steps, which could lead to another potential point of centralization if a majority of voting takes place via 3rd party custodians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"601\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f97dcfc7b91f_1m3zdPLmMz-LmCpXrwMXL0w.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3677\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f97dcfc7b91f_1m3zdPLmMz-LmCpXrwMXL0w.png 600w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f97dcfc7b91f_1m3zdPLmMz-LmCpXrwMXL0w-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><figcaption>Placeholder&#8217;s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.placeholder.vc\/blog\/2019\/1\/10\/funding-cryptonetworks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Cryptoeconomic Circle<\/a>&#8220;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stakeholder Diversity<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Placeholder\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@jmonegro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Joel Monegro&nbsp;<\/a>succinctly outlines the key stakeholders of decentralized networks in his piece, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.placeholder.vc\/blog\/2019\/1\/5\/the-cryptoeconomic-circle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Cryptoeconomic Circle<\/a>\u201d:&nbsp;<em>\u201cThe model describes a three-sided market between&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>miners<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;(the supply side),&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>users<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;(the demand side), and&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>investors<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;(the capital side).

However, in the same low voter turnout scenario, if a regular token holder proposes a vote, the proposal needs significantly more Yes votes than No votes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f99e65c7b920_1bs5p6Jo2ITAhsVYr9dtUog.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f99e65c7b920_1bs5p6Jo2ITAhsVYr9dtUog.png 800w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f99e65c7b920_1bs5p6Jo2ITAhsVYr9dtUog-768x414.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption>Polkadot\u2019s Adaptive Quorum Biasing<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adaptive Quorum Biasing provides Polkadot flexibility in low voter scenarios by basing voting majority requirements on turnout, making it easier or more difficult for a proposal to pass if there is no clear majority of voting power for or against it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the introduction of a council, Polkadot leverages weighted voting, based on two variables:&nbsp;<strong>tokens&nbsp;<\/strong>and&nbsp;<strong>time.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>tokens:&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><em>The amount of tokens under ownership by the voter;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>time:<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;The amount of time those tokens will remain locked after the referendum has ended, measured in multiples of enactment delay and bounded between one and six.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of tokens are multiplied by the designated time lock to calculate the total number of votes. Weighted voting creates an interesting dynamic whereby passionate voters are able to make their votes count more by increasing their exposure to a decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a miner may be willing to take more risk and voluntarily lock their tokens for the maximum amount of time when voting for a Referenda around a change to their bottom line. If the Referenda passes, the miner\u2019s tokens are locked and they face the economic implications of their decision by losing the ability to sell \/ exit the system until their tokens are unlocked. If the Referenda does not pass, the miner\u2019s tokens are not locked and they can sell or exit the system if they feel strongly enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f9ca86c7b922_0ybDJ_zW6zzpoBslh.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f9ca86c7b922_0ybDJ_zW6zzpoBslh.png 800w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f9ca86c7b922_0ybDJ_zW6zzpoBslh-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption>Polkadot\u2019s Weighted Voting Examples<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an oversimplification of Polkadot governance process, so I urge the curious to read more on GitHub or watch&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a2p9P776E1A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ryan Zurrer\u2019s presentation at AraCon 2019<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>DFINITY<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DFINITY directly addresses the shortfalls associated with the average user lacking direct subject matter expertise as previously discussed with the design of their Blockchain Nervous System (BNS), a form of Delegative Democracy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cBNS is an intelligent system that will accept proposals from different stakeholders and then decides on these proposals using votes made by human-controlled neurons. Every, interaction with the neuron is a learning experience for the BNS and it will continuously learn and adapt to make better decisions.

The relative voting power of a Neuron is proportional to the size of total deposits. Similar to Polkadot, if a voter wants to retrieve their deposited DFN, they must \u201cdissolve\u201d their deposit over a significant time period&nbsp;<em>(3 months or longer as outlined in initial BNS designs)<\/em>, creating a strong incentive for Neurons to contribute to net-positive decisions as the value of their locked DFN could fall otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, DFINITY incentives voter participation by rewarding Neurons with DFN whenever they vote, with rewards being calculated proportional to the size of the Neuron security deposit and the percentage of decisions they participate in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if the BNS sets voter rewards to 1%, a Neuron that has 100 DFN deposited and participates in all decisions will return 1 DFN, while another 100 DFN sized Neuron that only participations in 50% of the decisions will only return 0.5 DFN.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is a clear incentive to participate in every vote, with potentially dangerous repercussions associated with blindly voting, DFINITY allows Neuron\u2019s to follow the votes of other Neurons. By establishing Neuron follower relationships with trusted subject matter experts on relevant proposals, voters are able to delegate their decisions to perceived authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one can program their Neuron to follow a number of Core Developers for protocol-level proposals, or a group of Researchers they align with philosophically. This type of \u201cliquid democracy\u201d allows tokenholders to actively participate in on-chain votes for specific proposals they may not have the expertise to vote on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"307\" src=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f92326c7b923_0lfkuW7alloYFhWPp.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f92326c7b923_0lfkuW7alloYFhWPp.png 800w, https:\/\/wavegp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/5ccc76413871f92326c7b923_0lfkuW7alloYFhWPp-768x295.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption>Neuron follow relationships<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Moving Forward<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of experimentation and innovation happening in this space is exciting and provides hope that the barriers associated with low voter turnout will be solved.
