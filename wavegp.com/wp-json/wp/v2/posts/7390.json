Each of these decentralized applications adds to the strong foundation of the Cardano blockchain as it realizes a fully functional and diverse ecosystem.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new ADA Yield Fund represents the continuation of Wave\u2019s mission to support promising entrepreneurs within the crypto space beyond the early stage and foster greater innovation in the overall crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSince the formal launch of smart contracts in 2021, the Cardano community has launched and funded hundreds of companies building on the Cardano blockchain,\u201d said Charles Hoskinson, founder of Input Output, the software technology company that has been an early supporter of Cardano. \u201cCardano\u2019s growing ecosystem is hosting an ever expanding universe of applications supporting significant numbers of active users \u2013 it\u2019s critical for the success of the ecosystem that Cardano-based projects thrive, and so we are pleased that the ADA Yield Fund is committing substantial financial resources to facilitate continued growth and market acceptance.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, DeFi dApps are among the most popular in crypto in terms of bringing more users and applications&nbsp; on-chain. Specifically, decentralized exchanges (DEX) and defi lenders have gained the fastest popularity in terms of attracting users and capital. DEX typically are set up without market makers, but with two pools of assets that represent each side of a trading pair that serve as a source for DEX counterparties to trade against when they want to transact on either side of the pair. Wave will be using the ADA Yield Fund to provide liquidity to these pairs of pools to support Cardano DEXes. For DeFi lenders, there will also be a similar form of support to augment liquidity to facilitate lending. Also, Wave will continue to support and expand stake pools to strengthen the Cardano network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;EMURGO is excited to support the creation of this valuable ADA Yield Fund to further drive expansion and adoption of Cardano&#8217;s quickly developing DeFi ecosystem,&#8221; said Ken Kodama, founder &amp; CEO of EMURGO, a global blockchain solutions company and venture capital fund that has also been an early supporter of Cardano. &#8220;Providing strategic capital resources through the fund will help talented entrepreneurs and projects to build essential DeFi services on Cardano, ultimately delivering impactful solutions and onboarding more users to the global Cardano community.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wave is registered with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission as an investment adviser.
